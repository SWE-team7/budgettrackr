# Project Inception
_Group 07 – “[budgettrackr!]”\
Date and location: Sep 24, 2022\
Group Members: Braedon Behnke, Akiel Aries, Kyler Conant, Brock Heinz,
Brandon Mack

# 1. Introduction
Project is mainly focused on monitoring price trends and offering buyer’s 
services informing our clients on trends and comparisons. The outline of 
the project will have our clients search for a product of their choice and 
then have multiple vendors display and show a price trend visualization. 
This will help us understand what prices are at a high value at a certain 
vendor and which vendor will be a cheaper option. This will eventually lead 
to a build of a website that will be valuable to the consumer as they don't 
have to go to all websites to find the cheaper option.

# 2. Initial value proposition and consumer segments
The value for this proposition is considered very valuable in our eyes. 
As this product will show trends and track prices for a certain product. 
Not only will this help consumers save money but also see what vendor is at 
its lowest selling point during this time. Our target customer would be 
someone who shops online. While partaking in online shopping we can have a 
website that compares all popular websites to find the cheapest product 
searched for. The value we provide is ease of use and transparency to seeing 
how prices are on different websites. This will provide the value of life to 
relieve the hassle of moving from website to website and making sure you make 
the right decision to save more money on a certain product. Our product is 
considered very unique because we believe there is not really a big competitor 
out there. This is one if it’s kind showing a visualization of a price trend 
of a certain product with multiple big companies being compared.

in-person, however, when questioning I asked what would bring him to this website 
to possibly shop online more often. His biggest concern was being able to see 
the product and be able to compare for bulk purchases. May want to incorporate 
a graph which compares quantity as well as price.

This consumer said they don't often shop online but may look at prices every 2 
weeks - a month. When searching for a product they don't compare prices because 
they are just looking for a certain item and they have a trusted brand to look 
for. A shopping preference for them is considered Amazon, Amazon is also consider 
their top website to go to when online shopping. If they were to go in person 
to a store though it would most likely be best buy. The consumer suggested sorting
the have the cheapest price to the most expensive for the brand and also suggested 
a sales tracker rather than a price tracker because they rather see a product 
being bought more often than others when comparing.
