# 1 Description
Our program will lead you to a website that will compare prices among different websites with competitive prices. 
This will help you easily find any product with one click of a button. Once this button is clicked you will be able 
to compare prices across all big vendors. Giving the ease of search and taking time back to a whole other level!

Our program's main features are a selenium bot search to help scrape a web page and giving us information necessary 
to compare against other websites. A connection between docker and the bot to give us a website display. We have our 
search bar that will take in a search value and display exactly what we are looking for. Added to that we should be 
able to see graphs of prices going up and down within the year. 

# 2. Verification
## 2.1 Unit Tests
Since our project is Python-based with injection into HTML templates, budgettrackr utilizes the unittest framework 
for checks regarding our system. 
https://github.com/SWE-team7/budgettrackr/tree/main/tests shows two of the tests we perform. test_scrape.py tests 
the core part of our product, the scraping functionality. verify-python.py allows us to verify the python version 
being used in the project from workflows as well as the CLI locally.

## 2.2 Acceptance Tests
Acceptance tests run alongside our unittests within a Docker container that ensures passes before running the actual
app. This happens  upon every push and/or pull request to our main and sandbox development branches. To implement 
acceptance tests we made use of the behave + nosetest python frameworks for assuring functionality of our project. 
Our acceptance test folder, 
https://github.com/SWE-team7/budgettrackr/tree/sandbox/features

This is the link to our scrape acceptance test nearly identical to the corresponding unit test file but instead 
verifying scenarios given values specified in the test.feature file.
https://github.com/SWE-team7/budgettrackr/blob/main/features/steps/accept_scrape.py
Here is the workflow executing on a push to our sandbox branch, executing our unit tests, acceptance tests, and 
then building upon pass in a docker container.

# 3. Validation (user evaluation)
**Instructions:**
1. visit our deployed version of budgettrackr @ http://192.129.136.171:5000/
2. Search for a product

**Optional Instructions:**
1. Follow the instructions in our README to deploy your own instance

Questions: 
1. How is the overall look and feel of our product’s website? The homepage? Redirection?
2. How likely are you to use a product like this more specifically in a more developed state?
3. What are some other products you think of when seeing something like budgettrackr?


Interview 1: 
- User: Michael Percy
- Layout: 8/10
- Likely to use: 3.5/10	
- Feedback: 
Michael had said the overall look of our product’s home page is pleasing due to 
simplicity. Also saying he could envision something like this being useful with some 
more development behind it, even as a simple tool for users who enjoy easy-to-use products. When asked about comparisons to other tools of similar capacity, he immediately thought of something like Google's shopping tab that displays products when searched and options to buy at a plethora of different stores. Michael is not an avid online shopper so does not necessarily see himself using this product.  	

Interview 2:
- User: Yobe Haile
- Layout: 6/10
- Likely to use: 7/10
- Feedback: 
Yobe is also a Computer Science student so I figured it would be nice to see how usable 
our project is in an open-source kind of way. He was instructed to go through our project 
README to deploy his own instance of budgettrack and attempt to use it. After getting
through all of the documentation and steps included in our repository, Yobe was able to 
get budgettrackr up and running and attempt searching for products. When asked about 
the readability of our documentation he confirmed is was a simple enough project to 
allow for easy installation and use. He also included something like this could be useful 
to him and possibly others that are looking for a simple tool to use in their shopping 
endeavors also including that a lot of the bones and core functionality are present in our 
project, tying things together and optimization could take this project to more usable and 
promising state.  
	
Interview 3:
- User: Jake Fischer
- Layout: 7/10
- Likely to Use: 4/10 
- Feedback: 
Jake was the graphic designer who designed the overall layout of the web pages using Adobe Photoshop. Jake was
not able to get the instance running on his own, but was shown a general tutorial on what the program's functions 
are and how they are used. While the idea was appealing he said, it simply did not cater to his individual needs 
as a consumer. Moreover, the layout for the website, while it was as good as he could design it, was not to his 
professional standard due to the lack of miscellaneous features and things that would come with more time in 
development.
