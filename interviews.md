## Summary:
This consumer falls outside of our hypothesized best audience as he mainly shops 
in-person, however, when questioning I asked what would bring him to this website 
to possibly shop online more often. His biggest concern was being able to see 
the product and be able to compare for bulk purchases. May want to incorporate 
a graph which compares quantity as well as price.

Google Search Interface: Don't care
Product description: Nice to Have
## Summary:
This consumer said they don't often shop online but may look at prices every 2 
weeks - a month. When searching for a product they don't compare prices because 
they are just looking for a certain item and they have a trusted brand to look 
for. A shopping preference for them is considered Amazon, Amazon is also consider 
their top website to go to when online shopping. If they were to go in person 
to a store though it would most likely be best buy. The consumer suggested sorting
the have the cheapest price to the most expensive for the brand and also suggested 
a sales tracker rather than a price tracker because they rather see a product 
being bought more often than others when comparing.
